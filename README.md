## Features

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Install all dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Write your email inside `compose.md`** (supports markdown formatting)

    You can use variables, prefix them with $ sign.
    ```markdown
    Hi $NAME, your mail id is $EMAIL
    ```

6. **Prepare your data in `data.csv` file**. The first line (headers) must contain 'EMAIL' (uppercase) parameter.
